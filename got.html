			<h1>Day 1</h1>
			<p>Fly to Belfast. Once on land, you will be picked up from the airport and taken by van to the wonderful Millbrae Lodges where you will drop off your luggage and stay overnight.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="day-div" id="day-2" style="background-image: linear-gradient(-225deg, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.96) 0%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4) 50%),url(images/tollymore.jpg);">
			<h1>Day 2</h1>
			<p>The next day, we head for the Tollymore Forest Park, where two essential scenes of the very first episode of the series were filmed. It's a beautiful place with forests, waterfalls, bridges and some interesting buildings... But most of all, you'll be in the thick of it: this forest park is home to beautiful red woods, centuries-old stone buildings and the dreaded White Walkers. Known as the Haunted Forest of Westeros, this wilderness is where we first encounter the bloody creatures in Game of Thrones. It is also where the Starks first encountered their newborn werewolves. 
				Next stop is Leitrim Lodge, nestled at the foot of the Mourne Mountains, where Bran first met Meera and Jojen Reed.
				Lunch time; free time for 1.5 hours, several nice and affordable restaurants are nearby.
				Spend the afternoon as Jon Snow or Arya Stark by visiting Castle Ward. In the Seven Kingdoms, this huge estate has another name: Winterfell, the ancestral home of House Stark. Here you can practice archery at the same place where Jon Snow teaches Bran Stark to shoot a bow in season 1, wear authentic Westeros outfits... Then in the evening, you'll enjoy a sumptuous medieval banquet inspired by the series. 
				You will spend the night at the Ennikseen Country House Hotel, a so British hotel located at the foot of the Mourne Moutains.</p>

			<h1>Day 3</h1>
			<p>The day will start with a tour of the Toome Canal. The shores of Lough Neagh and the Toome Canal are a beautiful mix of forest, bog and fascinating wildlife. It was here that Tyrion Lannister was abducted by Jorah Mormont and taken prisoner in season 5, and it was at the Toome Canal, aka the Old Valyrian Canal in the series, that they were attacked by the Stone Men.
				At lunchtime, we headed to Antrim to taste some typical British dishes.
				After this invigorating meal, set off to visit the Valley of Shillanavogy, where, in the first season, the settings were used as a backdrop for the encampments of the Dothraki, a warrior and nomadic people. It is here that Daenerys Targaryen gradually learns to appreciate her role as Khaleesi and to love her husband, Chief Khal Drogo.
				Next, we head to Glenarifff Forest Park. Here, over millions of years, the Glens of Antrim have been shaped by Ice Age glaciers that transformed the landscape into a series of valleys and hills, creating a rich territory now dotted with charming villages and areas of incredible natural beauty. Not far from here is the hidden village of Galboly, where the filming of Moon Rock in Game of Thrones took place. This is where Lord Yohn Royce takes Robin Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, as his ward and where Sansa Stark and Littlefinger watch his warrior training.
				It is then time for the famous "tea time" that you will have in the middle of these extraordinary settings. 
				You will then stay overnight in a typical guest house of the region.</p>

			<h1>Day 4</h1>
			<p>The day will get off to a wonderful start with a visit to Cushendun's Cave, which is over 400 million years old. Cushenduns Cave is famous for a key scene in Season 2 when Melisandre, the Red Woman, gives birth to a 'shadow child' as a result of her affair with Stannis Baratheon, while Davos, Stannis' right-hand man, looks on in terror.
				At lunchtime, you will have a picnic in the Bay of the Serfs, located along the coastal road of the Northern Irish Giant's Causeway. It was in this bay that Tyrion Lannister and Jorah Mormont were captured by slavers on their way to Meereen. On a clear day you can see the Scottish islands on the other side of the North Channel. This is simply one of the most beautiful views in Northern Ireland, facing the Atlantic. 
				After lunch, head for Ballintoy Harbour. Ballintoy was originally a picturesque fishing village, just a short distance from the Giant's Causeway, Northern Ireland's famous natural landmark. For the purposes of the Game of Thrones series, it was transformed into the Greyjoy family's stronghold in the heart of the Iron Islands. It is here that Theon Greyjoy arrives at the capital of Lordsport after many years as Ned Stark's vassal. Not far from there, it is on the beach of Ballintoy that Euron Greyjoy is drowned in order to become king of the Iron Islands.
				The day ends with The Dark Hedges. The Dark Hedges look like something out of a fairy tale! The Dark Hedges is a walkway surrounded by towering, ghostly beech trees in beautiful County Antrim. It was along this path that the youngest Stark girl, Arya, left King's Landing at the beginning of season 2.
				In the evening, stop off at Gracehill House at the end of Dark Hedges. Here you can eat and view one of the Game of Thrones doors, which shows Bran's transformation into a Three-Eyed Crow.
				You will then spend the night in a hotel full of history.</p>

			<h1>Day 5</h1>
			<p>For this last day, head to Portstewart Beach. Here you will discover 2 miles of golden sand and listen to the gentle lapping of the waves. It was here, amongst the huge sand dunes dotted with tussocks, that Jaime and Bronn were captured by Dorne soldiers on the coast of Lancehélion. It was here, too, that Ellaria and the Sand Asps conspired to declare war on the Lannisters.
				For lunch, head to Harry's Shack; Georgina Campbell's favourite restaurant is the perfect place to enjoy delicious seafood while gazing out over the sunny ocean.
				In the afternoon, explore Mussenden Temple, which overlooks Downhill Beach. It is on this beach that Stannis Baratheon rejects the Seven Old Gods of Westeros. Melisandre proclaims him champion of the Master of Light and brings Peyredragon into the War of the Five Kings.
				Then it's time for the final visit of a week full of discovery and excitement. Discover the Cave of Pollnagolum, located in a forest behind a waterfall. It is within this cave that the Brotherhood without Banners of the Lannisters, the invaders, are hiding. Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie are captured by the rag-tag group while trying to get to Vivesaigues, and in the darkness of this cave, Sandor Clegane faces the fearless and immortal Beric Dondarrion, in his judicial duel...
				The trip comes to an end and we head for Belfast airport. A final surprise awaits you on the way, with a visit to a museum dedicated entirely to the series, which opened in February 2022.</p>
